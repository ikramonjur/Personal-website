  <h3> September 2018 - Present </h3>
  <p class = "projectpara"> Cornell Autonomous Bike is a research project team
    aimed to create a selfsteering, self-navigation, and self-balancing bicycle.
    I collaborate with other team members to enhance the autonomous bikeâ€™s navigation
    system. In Fall 2018, I worked on improving the localization of the bike by
    researching better GPSs and ways to mitigate GPS errors. </p>

  <h3> September 2018 - Present </h3>
  <p class = "projectpara"> The project I am currently working on is
    Autonomous Mini Robotic Cars for AI Driving Olympics Competition.
    In Fall 2018, I collaborated with a sub team of 5 students to
    work with machine learning algorithms for object detection/image processing for the
    vehicle. We used Python and ROS to enable the vehicle to complete tasks such as lane following,
    navigation with dynamic vehicles, and abiding by the regular traffic laws in the model town</p>

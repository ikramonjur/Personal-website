      My name is<span class = "BW">Ikra</span> and I am currently a college sophomore studying
      <span class = "BW">computer science</span> at Cornell University.
      I started coding when I was a sophomore in high school. I didn't actually
       know what computer science was until then and I am glad I decided to try
       it out. I love the thought process required to think through the problems
       and its applications. What I really like about computer science is its
        <span class = "BW">versatility</span>. I like how no matter what you are
        specifically interested in, computer science and programming can be
        applied to <span class = "BW">create</span> anything. </p>

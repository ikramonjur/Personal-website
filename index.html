      Hi! Thank you for visiting my site. My name is
      <span class = "BW">Ikra</span> and I am currently a college sophomore studying <span class = "BW">computer science</span> at Cornell University. I started coding when I was a sophomore in high school. I didn't actually know what computer science was until then and I am glad I decided to try it out. I love the thought process required to think through the problems and its applications. What I really like about computer science is its <span class = "BW">versatility</span>. I like how no matter what you are specifically interested in, computer science and programming can be applied to <span class = "BW">create</span> anything. I am specifically interested in <span class = "BW">robotics</span> and <span class = "BW">artificial intelligence.</span> I am currently involved in a project at a research lab in my university where I am working on an autonomous vehicle to learn more about robotics.
